USER was found last night strangled with his own USERBODYPART. The story went like this: the (building) was nice and quiet, so he decided to whip out the ol' (tool) and a picture of (celebrity) and get hammered. Unfortunately, as he began to (verb), he noticed someone in the corner of his vision. The mafia knocked him out with (an item found in a kitchen), and they got to work. He was discovered earlier this morning.
On a (adj) and (adj) night, USER was walking home from the (verb) club and realized that he made a wrong turn. He found himself surrounded by (number) (adj) (adj) (animate objects), all wielding (noun) from the (song) music video. As they were closing in on him, USER whispered, "(#phrase), Based God," before a USERANIMAL fell on on his head after the mafia sent out a (kind of bird) that mistook his head for a rock. He was pronounced dead at the hospital.
Yesterday, USER was walking down the street, accidentally bumped into someone, and said "(verb-ing) (noun)! Watch where you're going." Suddenly, (number) men grabbed him by his (body part), threw him into a (color) (car brand), and knocked him out. When USER woke up, he found himself buried alive in a USERCAR. He screamed out, "(song lyric)!". Some hipster bought the recording of that, but USER was never found.
Last night USER built the world's first time machine. He saw the dinosaurs, and the flying (adj) (nouns) of the future. He watched the world end as (animals) took over the universe, and reversed the big bang. But before he could return back in time, a hoard of rabid (inanimate objects) sliced right through him, leaving only a USERBODYPART left in the present.
Yesterday was the free admission day for the zoo, so naturally USER had to go. While feeding an (animal) a piece of (kind of bird) meat, he got a little too close to its' mouth, and a homeless man came and bit his USERBODYPART off. He died from shock.
